<p>Hello, I’m humble developer who works with a lot of JavaScript frameworks, libraries, modules, addons, plugins, browsers, preprocessors, processors, postprocessors, plugins for processors (<a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a>), plugins for browsers (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi">Ember inspector</a>), plugins for libraries (<a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>), addons for frameworks.</p>

<p>Isn’t it a lot of tools that we need to work with on daily basis? How big is your package.json file? Do you know what each dependency is doing? I’ve assumed here that all of them have a purpose in your project. So this is an assumption, and here’s the fact&#8202;—&#8202;each of them has name, which you probably need to remember. Some describe its usage&#8202;—&#8202;like anti-ecological <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tree-kill">tree-kill</a>, some not. It could take forever to guess what <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever">forever</a> is doing. Some names are similar but serve different purpose, like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pad-left">pad-left</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lpad">lpad</a>. Can you guess without clicking?</p>

<p>So, we see&#8202;—&#8202;there’s a lot of JavaScript third party code that you can use in your code. And it’s going to be more and more of that. And people will need to find new names. Programmers are not necessairly language teachers. Well, at least human language teachers. Well, umm, okay, <a href="https://www.italki.com/article/281/learning-english-by-learning-programming">this guy is</a>. So, he can name his library as he likes, because he’s entitled to do that.</p>

<p>Rest of us instead of finding well-suited names, often take random words and use it as name for our code. We, the programmers, like certain words more than the others. For example, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wrapper">wrapper</a> (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bin-wrapper">bin-wrapper</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/do-wrapper">do-wrapper</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/word-wrapper">word-wrapper</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/events-wrapper">events-wrapper</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/circuit-breaker-wrapper">circuit-breaker-wrapper</a>). There’s even a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rapper">rapper</a>. But it’s not normal rapper like Eminem, it’s more like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Construct wrappers around api RESTful endpoints (Browser/Angular/Node)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically rapper will give you wrapper.</p>
